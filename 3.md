# Git Ops Introduction
RHACM also having GitOps capabilities for deploying and managing Kubernetes services. The term GitOps is applied to applications or tools that are used to the deploy YAML files that are stored within a git repository. This repository can be private repository on GitHub or GitLab, on premise, or within a public git repository.  GitOps tools can be triggered to deploy or update Kubernetes objects either manually, through a webhook, or automatically. Some GitOps tools even offer the ability to prune or remove resources automatically that are not currently defined wtihin the git repository.

* Configuration is “pulled” into an environment similiar to running a `git pull` on your system
* Some tools require a component to be installed on all clusters. These tools will pull the objects into the cluster.
* Some tools do not require any remote resources to be running. Permissions are created on the remote clusters and configuration is pushed to the cluster.
* Templating available with [Helm](https://helm.sh/) or [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/)
* Quite simply “kubectl apply -f $path” runs over and over
* No Kubernetes object type creation limitations

## RHACM 

## Installing Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes

RHACM can be installed through an Operator via the Red Hat Operators Catalog.

You can follow the public documentation available here: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/1.0/html/install/

## Accessing the Web UI

You can then get the WebUI url for your just installed RHACM with this command:

~~~sh
oc  --context hubcluster -n open-cluster-management get route multicloud-console  -o jsonpath="{.status.ingress[*].host}{\"\n\"}"
~~~
 
## Adding Clusters

After accessing RHACM WebUI you can then import your clusters following the official documentation: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/1.0/html/manage_cluster/index

## List the available clusters 

After completing the import you should be able to see the just imported clusters:

~~~sh
oc get clusters -A --show-labels
as4test     as4test     api.as4test.lp.int:6443           Ready     1d
heisenbug   heisenbug   api.heisenbug.lplab.online:6443   Ready     1d
jelly       jelly       api.jelly.lplab.online:6443       Ready     1d
~~~

## Labeling the imported (or created) clusters

For achieving the right placement of the next labs, you'll need to set a label for identifying your just imported (or created) clusters.

***Please Note: pay attention to assign the right label to the respective cluster.***

~~~sh
oc label cluster -n YOUR_ACM_CLUSTER1_NAME YOUR_ACM_CLUSTER1_NAME clusterid=cluster1
oc label cluster -n YOUR_ACM_CLUSTER2_NAME YOUR_ACM_CLUSTER2_NAME clusterid=cluster2
oc label cluster -n YOUR_ACM_CLUSTER3_NAME YOUR_ACM_CLUSTER3_NAME clusterid=cluster3
~~~

You can check the correct labeling by executing this command:

~~~sh
oc get clusters -A --show-labels
~~~
