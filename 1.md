# Introduction and Prerequisites
In this lab we assumed that you want to try RH ACM gitops functions, you have one hub cluster and three managed clusters.
Managed clusters are added to hub cluster. 


At this point you should be logged in to the BastionVM and you should have the information for all three environment defined by the GuidGrabber.

During this lab we will utilize the RH ACM to define the clusters and repositories in which the RHACM deployment will manage. 

We will use [cfssl tooling](https://cfssl.org/) when dealing with TLS certificates.

## Verifications

Verify that RHACM is working:

~~~sh
oc config use-context hubcluster
oc get multiclusterhub -A
NAMESPACE                 NAME              AGE
open-cluster-management   multiclusterhub   4d19h
~~~

Verify that [cfssl](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/blob/master/README.md#using-the-command-line-tool) is working:

~~~sh
cfssl version

Version: 1.2.0
Revision: dev
Runtime: go1.6
~~~

Verify that [cfssljson](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/blob/master/README.md#using-the-command-line-tool) is working:

~~~sh
cfssljson -help

Usage of cfssljson:
