# Hands on with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management: Application Portability

During the labs you will be deploying workloads on three OpenShift 4 clusters. 

One cluster will be Hub and other three cluster will be Spoke clusters.

We assume clusters are ready Red Hat ACM installed and you have access to clusters, anyway we link the proper documentation during the lab so you can proceed with needed steps.

***Please note:*** Just because we're going to use deployment model based on GitOps, we need to leverage Github, so the first prerequisite before starting the lab is to *clone* this repo.
